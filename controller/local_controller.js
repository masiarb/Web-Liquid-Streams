/**
 * LOCAL CONTROLLER
 * Local Controller does the same exact job as the (global) controller.
 * It will gather the req_rate and ans_rate of the specific cluster and perform computations, deciding
 * if it's the case to add more workers or not to the cluster. This differs from the global controller
 * as it has a global view and acts globally on all the clusters, while the local controller only acts
 * on the single cluster. The idea is to have one local controller for each cluster. Local controller
 * is instantiated as a cluster is instantiated. It is instantiated in the same node where the first(s)
 * worker(s) for that cluster is(are) instantiated.
